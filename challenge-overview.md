# Hackathon Challenge

> Build an AI-powered application that uses Dapr Workflow Orchestration to enable intelligent behavior across services, systems, or environments.

## Key Technologies

* **[Dapr Workflow API](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/workflow/workflow-overview/):** for orchestrating multi-step processes, retries, approvals, and AI pipelines.
* **[Dapr Agents](https://dapr.github.io/dapr-agents/):** for implementing autonomous, intelligent services that operate collaboratively.

## Development Approach

* Use **[Dapr OSS](https://dapr.io/)** if you're building entirely within Kubernetes and want direct control of your infrastructure.
* Use **[Diagrid Catalyst](https://www.diagrid.io/catalyst)** to simplify Dapr operations and access Dapr APIs across any compute platform — including Kubernetes, serverless functions, PaaS, VMs, or edge environments.

### Benefits of Diagrid Catalyst

* Spin up remote Dapr sidecars through a centralized SaaS platform managed by Diagrid.
* Use Dapr with Kubernetes workloads without managing the control plane.
* Extend Dapr to non-Kubernetes platforms using the same APIs.
* Eliminate the operational overhead of running and maintaining Dapr OSS.

All participants receive access to a free Catalyst environment with increased limits for use during the hackathon.

## Challenge Categories

### **Collaborative Intelligence**

Build systems where multiple agents, services, or components collaborate to solve tasks intelligently.

Examples:

* Team-based AI decision making
* Agent-to-agent coordination
* Dynamic negotiation and planning

### **AI Workflows for the Real World**

Solve complex, real-world challenges with resilient, intelligent workflows.

Examples:

* Fraud detection and escalation
* Healthcare triage
* Smart automation pipelines

### **Distributed and Edge Intelligence**

Design AI applications that operate across cloud, edge devices, and hybrid environments.

Examples:

* IoT coordination
* Drone fleets or autonomous vehicles
* Edge-first predictive systems

### **Responsible AI Systems**

Build AI applications that are ethical, safe, and resilient, with oversight mechanisms.

Examples:

* Human-in-the-loop AI
* Compliance and audit workflows
* Failure recovery systems

## Bonus: Using Diagrid Catalyst

If your app spans multiple environments — cloud functions, VMs, edge — use **Diagrid Catalyst** to easily call Dapr APIs without managing Kubernetes.

> [!TIP]
> Projects using Catalyst creatively (multi-cloud, hybrid, edge) are eligible for bonus prizes.
