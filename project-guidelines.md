# Project Guidelines: Submission, Judging, and Prizes

To qualify for judging, you must submit a project issue using the [Project Submission template](https://github.com/diagrid-labs/dapr-ai-hackathon/issues/new/choose) by **June 27**.

## 📥 Submission Requirements

Your submission must include:

* **Project Name and Summary:** A brief overview of your application and core use case.
* **Challenge Category:** Choose one of the four outlined categories.
* **Technology Used:** Specify whether you used Dapr OSS, Catalyst, or both — and which Dapr APIs were used (Workflow API, Pub/Sub, State, etc.).
* **Code Repository:** Link to a GitHub repository containing your code. Your `README.md` must explain project features and include instructions for running and deploying the app. If the repo is private, grant access to the judging panel.
* **Demo Video (3–5 minutes):** Show your working app, the workflow or agent behavior, and how Dapr and/or Catalyst were used.
* **Optional (but encouraged):**

  * Screenshots, architecture diagram, or supporting visuals.
  * A hosted frontend, dashboard, or API endpoint (if applicable) for judges to explore.

> \[!NOTE]
> Missing or incomplete entries may be disqualified from judging. Make sure your submission is comprehensive and accessible.
