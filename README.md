# Dapr AI Hackathon x Diagrid

Join us for the **Dapr AI Hackathon x Diagrid** ‚Äî a global challenge to build intelligent, resilient, and scalable AI applications using the power of **Dapr Workflows** and **Dapr Agents**.

Harness the flexibility of **Dapr open-source** within Kubernetes, or expedite your Dapr API usage through **Diagrid Catalyst** to create next-generation applications that span cloud, serverless, and edge environments.

Whether you're orchestrating autonomous agents, designing durable AI pipelines, or ensuring responsible AI behavior, this hackathon is your opportunity to push the boundaries of distributed intelligence.

## Rules and Eligibility

Read the [Official Content Rules](./OfficialContestRules.md) thoroughly for all contest rules and eligibility criteria.

## üóìÔ∏è Timeline

- **Hackathon Kickoff:** 5/9  
- **Submission Deadline:** 6/27  
- **Announcement of Winners:** 7/11  

## Challenge

> Build an AI-powered application that uses Dapr Workflow Orchestration to enable intelligent behavior across services, systems, or environments.

**Key technologies:**

- **Dapr Workflow API:** for orchestrating multi-step processes, retries, approvals, and AI pipelines.
- **Dapr Agents:** for implementing autonomous, intelligent services that operate collaboratively.

**Development approach**:

- Use **Dapr OSS** if you're building entirely within Kubernetes and want direct control of your infrastructure.
- Use **Diagrid Catalyst** to simplify Dapr operations and access Dapr APIs across any compute platform ‚Äî including Kubernetes, serverless functions, PaaS, VMs, or edge environments.

Catalyst allows you to:

- Spin up remote Dapr sidecars through a centralized SaaS platform managed by Diagrid to reduce infrastructure complexity.
- Use Dapr with Kubernetes workloads without managing the control plane yourself.
- Extend Dapr's power to non-Kubernetes compute platforms with the same consistent APIs.
- Eliminate the operational burden of running and maintaining Dapr OSS, so you can focus on building great applications.

All participants who sign up for the hackathon will receive access to a free Catalyst environment with increased limits for use throughout the hacking period.

## Challenge Categories

### **Collaborative Intelligence**

> Build systems where multiple agents, services, or components collaborate to solve tasks intelligently.

Examples:

- Team-based AI decision making
- Agent-to-agent coordination
- Dynamic negotiation and planning

### **AI Workflows for the Real World**

> Solve complex, real-world challenges with resilient, intelligent workflows that span multiple steps or services.

Examples:

- Fraud detection and escalation
- Healthcare triage
- Smart automation pipelines

### **Distributed and Edge Intelligence**

> Design AI applications that work across cloud, edge devices, and hybrid environments ‚Äî orchestrated with Dapr.

Examples:

- IoT coordination
- Drone fleets or autonomous vehicles
- Edge-first predictive systems

### **Responsible AI Systems**

> Build AI applications that are traceable, ethical, safe, and resilient, with built-in recovery and oversight.

Examples:

- Human-in-the-loop AI
- Compliance and audit workflows
- Failure recovery and fallback systems

## Bonus: Using Diagrid Catalyst

If your app needs to work across multiple compute environments ‚Äî cloud functions, VMs, or edge ‚Äî use **Diagrid Catalyst** to easily call Dapr APIs without needing to manage Kubernetes. Catalyst unlocks Dapr workflows and agents anywhere!

*Tip:* Projects that show creative use of Catalyst are eligible (multi-cloud, hybrid, edge) for bonus prizes.

## üìù Registration Criteria

To register as an official hackathon participant you must fill out the participation form here: [ ]. Whether you choose to participate as a team, or as an individual, you must fill out the form.

**Important**: Before registering, it is recommended to read the official contest rules. These rules dictate who is eligible to participate and receive prize money, along with the registration and submission requirements in more detail.

Once you have completed the registration, you will receive a confirmation email with more details and a reminder of the following registration requirements:

1. You must join the Diagrid Discord channel where you can connect to other Hackathon participants, introduce yourself, connect with Dapr experts, find teammates, etc.
1. You must create an issue in this GitHub repo using the `Project Submission` template as a placeholder for your submission. This can also be used to help source teammates who may be interested in joining your efforts.

## üìù Submission Criteria

To qualify for judging, your `Project Submission` issue must be updated by 6/27 to include:

- **Project Name and Summary:** A brief overview of your application and its core use case.
- **Which category you‚Äôre submitting under** (from the four provided)
- **Technology Used:** Indicate whether you used Dapr OSS, Catalyst, or both ‚Äî and which Dapr APIs you leveraged (Workflow API, Pub/Sub, State, etc.).
- **Link to Code Repository:** A URL to a GitHub repository where the code for the project is hosted. The repository should contain a `README.md` file outlining the project's features and functionality with instructions on how to run and deploy the solution. If your repo is private, access must be granted to the judging panel.
- **Demo Video (3‚Äì5 minutes):** Show the working application, the workflow or agent behavior, and highlight how Dapr and/or Catalyst was used.
- **Optional (but encouraged):** Screenshots, architecture diagram, or supporting materials.
- **Optional (but encouraged):** If your app includes a frontend, dashboard, or API service, please share a hosted link or public endpoint for judges to explore.
