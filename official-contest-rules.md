- Completed Feedback Submission Form | Provide complete and comprehensive feedback at https://diagrid.ws/hackathon-feedback.
(each a “Feedback Submission”).

### Multiple Submissions

An Entrant may submit more than one Submission, however, each Submission must be unique and substantially different from each of the Entrant’s other Submissions, as determined by the Sponsor in their sole discretion.

### Submission Ownership

Be the original work of the Entrant, be solely owned by the Entrant, and not violate the IP rights of any other person or entity.

### Testing

Access must be provided to the Sponsor and Administrator by providing a URL to a GitHub code repository. A running application is optional, but helpful for the judges to conduct a thorough review of the project functionality.

### Language Requirements

All Submission materials must be in English or, if not in English, the Entrant must provide an English translation of the demonstration video, text description, and testing instructions as well as all other materials submitted.

### Team Representation

If multiple Eligible Individuals choose to collaborate on a project as a team (a “Team”), the Team must appoint one member as its designated representative (the “Representative”). The Representative will be solely responsible for submitting the Team’s project (a “Submission”) on behalf of all Team members and must meet all eligibility requirements set forth above.

By submitting a project on behalf of a Team, the Representative represents and warrants that they are duly authorized by all members of the Team to:  
(a) act on the Team’s behalf,  
(b) submit the Team’s Submission, and  
(c) bind each member of the Team to these Official Rules.

#### Team Prize Distribution and Disputes

In the event a Team is selected as a winner, the prize will be awarded to the Representative, and it will be the sole responsibility of the Representative to distribute any prize among Team members. The Sponsor and Administrator shall have no responsibility or liability for any disputes among Team members related to prize sharing, ownership of Submission materials, or any other matter.

#### Team Collaboration Responsibility

Team formation and collaboration are solely the responsibility of the participants. The Sponsor and Administrator will not be responsible for assisting in team formation, coordination, communication, or dispute resolution during or after the Hackathon. Participation as a Team is at the discretion of the participants and is undertaken at their own risk.

### Intellectual Property

Each Submission must:  
(a) be the original work product of the Entrant (or Team),  
(b) be solely owned by the Entrant or Team, with no other individual or entity holding any rights or interests in the Submission, and  
(c) not infringe upon or misappropriate the intellectual property rights or other legal rights—including, but not limited to, copyrights, trademarks, patents, contract rights, or rights of privacy or publicity—of any third party.

Entrants may engage third parties for technical assistance in the creation of the Submission, provided that the Submission remains the sole work product of the Entrant or Team, reflects their original ideas and creativity, and that the Entrant or Team retains full ownership of all resulting components.

Submissions may incorporate open source software or hardware, so long as the Entrant complies with the applicable open source licenses. Submissions that build upon and enhance existing open source projects must do so in a manner that adds original value and functionality.

By entering the Hackathon, each Entrant represents, warrants, and agrees that their Submission complies with all of the above requirements.

### Use of AI Tools and Generative Technologies

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and generative technologies (e.g., large language models, code generation tools, image synthesis) to support the creation of Submissions is permitted and encouraged. However, Submissions must clearly document how such tools were used—whether for ideation, prototyping, code generation, or content creation.

Entrants are expected to demonstrate originality and innovation beyond what is directly produced by AI tools. Judges may take into consideration the thoughtful integration, prompting, and refinement of generative outputs as part of evaluating creativity and effort. Full transparency in the role AI played in the submission process is required.

### Financial or Preferential Support

A Project must not have been developed, or derived from a Project developed, with financial or preferential support from the Sponsor or Administrator. Such Projects include, but are not limited to, those that received funding or investment for their development, were developed under contract, or received a commercial license, from the Sponsor or Administrator any time prior to the end of Hackathon Submission Period. The Sponsor, at their sole discretion, may disqualify a Project, if awarding a prize to the Project would create a real or apparent conflict of interest.

## 5. Submission Modifications

The Sponsor may permit you to modify part of your Submission after the Submission Period for the purpose of adding, removing or replacing material that potentially infringes a third party mark or right, discloses personally identifiable information, or is otherwise inappropriate. The modified Submission must remain substantively the same as the original Submission with the only modification being what the Sponsor permits.

## 6. Judges & Criteria

Eligible Submissions will be evaluated by a panel of judges selected by the Sponsor (the “Judges”). Judges may be employees of the Sponsor or third parties, may or may not be listed individually on the Hackathon Website, and may change before or during the Judging Period. Judging may take place in one or more rounds with one or more panels of Judges, at the discretion of the Sponsor.

All Project Submissions will be evaluated based on the following equally weighted criteria (the “Judging Criteria”):

### Judging Criteria

All eligible Submissions will be evaluated by the Judges based on the following equally weighted criteria. Bonus points may be awarded at the Judges' discretion for standout elements noted below.

- **Project Completeness and Category Alignment**  
  Does the project clearly address one of the defined challenge categories? Is it well-scoped and complete? Does it demonstrate meaningful use of orchestration patterns (e.g., workflows, agents) with minimal shortcuts or incomplete components?

- **Creativity and Innovation**  
  Is the problem being solved original or approached in a novel way? Does the project introduce a unique or unconventional perspective on how to use Dapr and Catalyst to build intelligent applications?

- **Technical Excellence**  
  Is the codebase clean, functional, and well-structured? Does the project demonstrate strong engineering fundamentals and effective use of Dapr building blocks (e.g., pub/sub, service invocation, state management, bindings)? Does it show thoughtful integration of Dapr APIs?

- **Project Delivery**  
  How clearly was the project’s architecture, approach, and implementation communicated? Is clear solution documentation present and well thought out? Does the presentation aid in understanding and evaluating the solution?

- **Distributed Thinking** *(Bonus)*  
  Does the project demonstrate thoughtful use of distributed system patterns such as multi-region deployment, serverless integration, edge computing, or polyglot app composition?

The Judges will assign scores for each criterion and may award bonus points for exceptional execution or innovation. Submissions with the highest total scores will be deemed potential winners. In the event of a tie, the Judges and/or Sponsor will make the final determination.

The scores from the Judges will determine the potential winners of the applicable prizes. The Entrant(s) that are eligible for a Prize, and whose Submissions earn the highest overall scores based on the applicable Judging Criteria, will become potential winners of that Prize. If two or more Submissions are tied, a decision will be made by the Judges and/or the Sponsor.

### Feedback Period

Entrants submitting a Feedback Submission must provide feedback from first-hand experience upon completing a Project, ensuring the relevance and authenticity of the insights shared.
All Feedback Submissions will be evaluated based on the thoroughness, practicality, and feasibility of the feedback provided. Incomplete feedback submissions may be subject to disqualification at the discretion of the Sponsor.

## 7. Intellectual Property Rights
