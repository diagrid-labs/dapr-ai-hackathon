### ðŸ†• [Workflow Composer](https://workflows.diagrid.io) â€” Instantly generate Dapr apps from diagrams

**Workflow Composer** is a free, AI-powered tool that turns workflow diagrams into fully functional Dapr Workflow applications. Use it to accelerate prototyping or jumpstart real implementationsâ€”no boilerplate required.

**How it works:**

1. Create a diagram using tools like Excalidraw, draw\.io, Lucidchart, etc.
2. Upload it to Workflow Composer and choose your programming language.
3. Download a complete Dapr workflow app, including activity stubs, configs, and instructions.

**Why use it:**

* Generate apps in **Python, Java, .NET, JavaScript, or Go**
* Supports **conditional logic, external events, timers, and branching**
* Works with **common notations** like BPMN and freeform diagrams
* Produced code is yours to extend and deploy

Try it out here ðŸ‘‰ [workflow-composer.diagrid.io](https://workflows.diagrid.io)

> [!TIP]
> Great way to get started if youâ€™re unsure how to structure your workflow project.
> Can also be a great resource to reference for the AI-powered development bonus prize!
